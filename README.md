# Proposal
## Description
We are building a program to generate a weekly chore schedule for the Management Team. There are 5 
different chores which include; kitchen, floors, bathrooms, lobby, and trash. Two people are 
assigned one chore per day of the week. One user is only able to work two chores per week. 
Each chore should be checked off by a manager. A manager can only check off 3 chores a week. 
Users and Managers should be notified both when a new schedule is uploaded and when a chore is
not completed.
## Prior Art
The Management Team usually creates all schedules by hand which take time especially if one can 
not do a particular chore that day. We are creating a similar way of creating those schedules 
without having to recreate the entire thing. 
## Core User Workflows
- Users can create/ login to an account
- Users can choose a role either Manger or Worker
- Workers can create a schedule with the chores they chose.
- Mangers can edit the schedule
- Mangers can to check off 3 chores
