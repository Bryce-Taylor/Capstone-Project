# Proposal
## Description
We are building a program to generate a weekly chore schedule for the Management Team. 
The purpose of the Chore Management System is to automatically create a new chore schedule 
and scorecard each week. Each user will be assigned to what chore they are doing on that 
day. Managers check off on chores. The scorecard is used to measure individual and group performance. 

There are 5 different chores which include; kitchen, floors, bathrooms, lobby, and trash. Two people 
are assigned one chore per day of the week. One user is only able to work two chores per week. Each 
chore should be checked off by a manager. A manager can only check off 3 chores a week. Users and 
Managers should be notified both when a new schedule is uploaded and when a chore is not completed. 
Managers don't do chores.

## Prior Art
The Management Team usually creates all schedules by hand which take time especially if one can 
not do a particular chore that day. We are creating a similar way of creating those schedules 
without having to recreate the entire thing. We attempted to look for similar projects for job scheduling
but could not find any web applications in spring.

## Core User Workflows
1. Login - Users can create/ login to an account
2. Sign Up - Users can choose a role either Manger or Worker at Sign up.
3. Schedules -  User can sign in and see schedule for this week and following week.
4. Adjusting Schedules - Mangers can edit the schedule
5. Managers limitations - Mangers can to check off 3 chores
6. User limitations - Users can only work 2 days a week
7. Email - Users will receive an email about the schedule
8. Scorecards - Everyone will receive a scorecard with performance percentage
